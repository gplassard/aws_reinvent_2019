In this session, the company discusses leveraging tools such as Open Telemetry, Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES), and Jaeger to build an observability solution, and the benefits this solution provides by giving visibility across the platform, from containers to serverless applications. They also discuss how they see observability evolving in coming years. ",

GitOps refers to a set of continuous delivery best practices by enabling developers to do operations using Git as a source of truth. The aim is immutable infrastructure and declarative orchestration. So how do you enforce this in the pipeline? Development teams use native tools such as AWS CloudFormation and open-source tools such as Terraform and Packer to define their infrastructure and images. In this chalk talk, we illustrate an example and discuss how to enforce immutable infrastructure using AWS Config rules, AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and Packer with insights in AWS Security Hub.

        "abstract": "Deploying deep learning models in a low latency micro-services environment is challenging. However, without this, we wouldn't have many of the AI applications that we have today, such as voice response systems, fast image and video analytics, responsive visual search engines, and real-time predictions for business transactions, such as for ride-hailing apps. These challenges are due to the high amount of compute involved, latencies of models and costs, difficulties in deployment, A/B testing, and monitoring performance. In this session, we demonstrate Amazon Elastic Inference, Amazon SageMaker Neo and batch inference, AWS Inferentia, and AWS X-Ray, and we discuss how to use these services to overcome these challenges.

In this example, donors register their profiles, review the causes the nonprofit supports, and donate funds. Using smart contracts, the nonprofit distributes the funds, and the network tracks how each donation is allocated. ",

In this workshop, learn how to leverage Keras/TensorFlow deep-learning frameworks to build a text-classification solution using custom algorithms on Amazon SageMaker. We walk you through packaging custom training code in a Docker container, testing it locally, and then using Amazon SageMaker to train a deep-learning model. You then try to iteratively improve the model to achieve high accuracy. Finally, you deploy the model in production so applications can leverage the classification service. ",

However, without this, we wouldn't have many of the AI applications that we have today, such as voice response systems, fast image and video analytics, responsive visual search engines, and real-time predictions for business transactions, such as for ride-hailing apps. These challenges are due to the high amount of compute involved, latencies of models and costs, difficulties in deployment, A/B testing, and monitoring performance. In this session, we demonstrate Amazon Elastic Inference, Amazon SageMaker Neo and batch inference, AWS Inferentia, and AWS X-Ray, and we discuss how to use these services to overcome these challenges.
