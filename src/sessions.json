This service lets you build, train, and deploy ML models using built-in or custom algorithms. In this workshop, learn how to leverage Keras/TensorFlow deep-learning frameworks to build a text-classification solution using custom algorithms on Amazon SageMaker. We walk you through packaging custom training code in a Docker container, testing it locally, and then using Amazon SageMaker to train a deep-learning model. You then try to iteratively improve the model to achieve high accuracy. Finally, you deploy the model in production so applications can leverage the classification service. ",

Automatic model tuning lets you skip the tedious trial-and-error process of manually adjusting model parameters and instead performs hyperparameter optimization by discovering interesting features in your data and learning how those features interact to affect accuracy. You save days or even weeks of time. ",
